      <p className="mt-4 p-5 text-2xl">
        LAMB aims to tackle the challenges associated with
        relocating to a different city or state. When individuals relocate, they
        often lack the necessary experience and familiarity with the new area to
        choose safe and suitable housing that aligns with their hobbies, values,
        and lifestyle. Our target audience consists of young adults seeking
        assistance with relocation for work. This group faces the daunting task
        of finding suitable housing in an unfamiliar location.

        To address these concerns, LAMB offers personalized city
        recommendations based on users' preferences and needs. LAMB provides
        information about the city's safety, amenities, public transportation,
        and local attractions. By focusing on the needs of young adults
        relocating for work, our web applicayion seeks to provide valuable
        assistance and alleviate the stress associated with the relocation
        process. We aspire to empower individuals in making informed decisions
